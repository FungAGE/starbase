Here, we report the discovery of a putative giant tyrosine-recombinase-mobilized DNA transposon, Enterprise, from the model fungus Podospora anserina. Previously, we described a large genomic feature called the Spok block which is notable due to the presence of meiotic drive genes of the Spok gene family. The Spok block ranges from 110 kb to 247 kb and can be present in at least four different genomic locations within P. anserina, despite what is an otherwise highly conserved genome structure. We propose that the reason for its varying positions is that the Spok block is not only capable of meiotic drive but is also capable of transposition. More precisely, the Spok block represents a unique case where the Enterprise has captured the Spoks, thereby parasitizing a resident genomic parasite to become a genomic hyperparasite. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Enterprise (without the Spoks) is found in other fungal lineages, where it can be as large as 70 kb. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence that the Spok block is deleterious, with detrimental effects on spore production in strains which carry it. This union of meiotic drivers and a transposon has created a selfish element of impressive size in Podospora, challenging our perception of how TEs influence genome evolution and broadening the horizons in terms of what the upper limit of transposition may be.","2021-01-05","2023-02-22 15:46:54","2023-02-22 15:46:54","2023-02-22 15:46:54","789-798",,"5","31",,Genome Res.,,,,,,,,en,,,,,genome.cshlp.org,,Company: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Distributor: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Institution: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Label: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Lab PMID: 33875482,,"; /home/adrian/zotero-attachments/Vogan et al (2021) The Enterprise, a massive transposon carrying Spok meiotic drive genes.pdf",http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33875482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,

In bacteria, differences in gene distributions among individuals largely result from mobile elements that acquire and disperse accessory genes as cargo. In contrast, the impact of cargo-carrying elements on eukaryotic evolution remains largely unknown. Here, we show that variation in genome content within multiple fungal species is facilitated by Starships, a newly discovered group of massive mobile elements that are 110 kb long on average, share conserved components, and carry diverse arrays of accessory genes. We identified hundreds of Starship-like regions across every major class of filamentous Ascomycetes, including 28 distinct Starships that range from 27 to 393 kb and last shared a common ancestor ca. 400 Ma. Using new long-read assemblies of the plant pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina, we characterize four additional Starships whose activities contribute to standing variation in genome structure and content. One of these elements, Voyager, inserts into 5S rDNA and contains a candidate virulence factor whose increasing copy number has contrasting associations with pathogenic and saprophytic growth, suggesting Voyager’s activity underlies an ecological trade-off. We propose that Starships are eukaryotic analogs of bacterial integrative and conjugative elements based on parallels between their conserved components and may therefore represent the first dedicated agents of active gene transfer in eukaryotes. Our results suggest that Starships have shaped the content and structure of fungal genomes for millions of years and reveal a new concerted route for evolution throughout an entire eukaryotic phylum.","2022-05-01","2023-02-22 15:47:19","2023-02-22 15:47:19","2023-02-22 15:47:19",msac109,,"5","39",,Molecular Biology and Evolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/home/adrian/zotero-attachments/Gluck-Thaler et al (2022) Giant Starship Elements Mobilize Accessory Genes in Fungal Genomes.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,

Eukaryotic microbes face similar stresses; however, a parallel role for mobile elements has not been established. A stress faced by many microorganisms is toxic metal ions in their environment. In fungi, identified mechanisms for protection against metals generally rely on genes that are dispersed within an organism’s genome. Here, we discover a large (∼85 kb) region that confers tolerance to five metal/metalloid ions (arsenate, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc) in the genomes of some, but not all, strains of a fungus, Paecilomyces variotii. We name this region HEPHAESTUS (Hφ) and present evidence that it is mobile within the P. variotii genome with features characteristic of a transposable element. HEPHAESTUS contains the greatest complement of host-beneficial genes carried by a transposable element in eukaryotes, suggesting that eukaryotic transposable elements might play a role analogous to bacteria in the horizontal transfer of large regions of host-beneficial DNA. Genes within HEPHAESTUS responsible for individual metal tolerances include those encoding a P-type ATPase transporter—PcaA—required for cadmium and lead tolerance, a transporter—ZrcA—providing tolerance to zinc, and a multicopper oxidase—McoA—conferring tolerance to copper. In addition, a subregion of Hφ confers tolerance to arsenate. The genome sequences of other fungi in the Eurotiales contain further examples of HEPHAESTUS, suggesting that it is responsible for independently assembling tolerance to a diverse array of ions, including chromium, mercury, and sodium.","2022-03-14","2023-02-22 15:47:34","2023-02-22 15:47:34","2023-02-22 15:47:34","937-950.e5",,"5","32",,Current Biology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/home/adrian/Zotero/storage/SN9BB3GS/S0960982221017358.html; /home/adrian/zotero-attachments/Urquhart et al (2022) A large transposable element mediates metal resistance in the fungus.pdf,,,horizontal gene transfer; Eurotiales; metal homeostasis; transposon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,

The               Starships               are a recently discovered feature in fungal genomes that are, in some cases, predicted to confer beneficial traits to their hosts and also have hallmarks of being transposable elements. Here, we provide experimental evidence that               Starships               are indeed autonomous transposons, using the model               Paecilomyces variotii               , and identify the HhpA “Captain” tyrosine recombinase as essential for their mobilization into genomic sites with a specific target site consensus sequence. Furthermore, we identify multiple recent horizontal gene transfers of               Starships               , implying that they jump between species. Fungal genomes have mechanisms to defend against mobile elements, which are frequently detrimental to the host. We discover that               Starships               are also vulnerable to repeat-induced point mutation defense, thereby having implications on the evolutionary stability of such elements.","2023-04-11","2023-10-17 13:55:49","2023-10-17 13:55:49","2023-10-17 13:55:49",e2214521120,,"15","120",,Proc.
