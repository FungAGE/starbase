- [ ] fill in family ids 
  - the fill in should try the following steps, in this order:
    - inherit from existing classifications
    - fill in based on shared navis haplotypes
    - classify using captain sequences
- [ ] fill in taxonomy ids
  - import from mycotools tables
  - lookup from ncbi taxdump
  - perform more intensive searches? i.e. `taxize`
- [ ] update gff table
  - add updated annotations
  - make sure schema is compatible with MAS table(s)
- [ ] `captains` table
  - make sure connection to `joined_ships` table is correct by checking header in `.faa` file?
  - add in captain protein sequences identified using hmmer/blast? (with "blast" in the "evidence" column)
